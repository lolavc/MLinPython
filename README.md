## Machine Learning Project in Python
### Analysis of the Dataset: Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition
This project investigates the estimation of obesity levels utilizing machine learning methods, focusing on unsupervised and supervised techniques. 
The dataset used is sourced from an online survey conducted on eating habits and physical conditions in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (Palechor and Manotas, 2019). 
The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of unsupervised and supervised models in predicting obesity and to compare their effectiveness.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Exploratory Analysis:    
Conducted an exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:  
Cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure data quality and compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

3. Unsupervised ML Method:  
Applied and evaluated Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) as an unsupervised learning method to identify patterns and clusters within the data.

4. Supervised ML Models - Fitted four supervised machine learning models:  
     - K-nearest neighbors (KNN) with uniform weights,
     - K-nearest neighbors with distance weights (KNN-distance),
     - Decision Trees (DTs), and
     - Random Forest Classifier (RFC).

5. Model Evaluation:  
Evaluated and validated the performance of the supervised models using k-fold cross-validation to assess their predictive accuracy and generalization capability.
